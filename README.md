# Movie-Recommendation-Machine-Learning-
This is an end-to-end movie recommendation system built using machine learning and Flask. The project takes user input in the form of movie preferences or ratings and recommends similar movies based on these preferences.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Model:
     *Uses collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques to generate movie recommendations.

Flask Web Application:
     *A lightweight web interface is created with Flask to allow users to interact with the system and view recommendations.
User Interface: 
     *Simple, user-friendly interface where users can input their movie preferences or ratings.
Data Source:
     *Movie data is sourced from popular databases like IMDb or MovieLens.
Recommendation Logic:
     *The system uses a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, KNN, or matrix factorization) to predict and suggest movies.
Technologies Used:

Python:- For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Flask:- For creating the web application and API.
Pandas:- For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn:- For machine learning model development.
HTML/CSS:- For frontend interface.


How to Run:
  Clone this repository.
  Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
  Run the Flask app using python app.py.
  Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start interacting with the movie recommendation system.
  Future Enhancements:
  Implementing deep learning techniques for more personalized recommendations.
  Adding movie details (e.g., trailers, reviews) alongside recommendations.
  Integrating user authentication for a more tailored experience.
